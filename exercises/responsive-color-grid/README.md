# Responsive color grid from scratch

Here are the colors:

#F5C6D6
#EE2E84
#85CFD8
#8DC63F
#E76E34
To practice media queries, you must make this color grid keep it's regular form (look like the picture above) from large screens down until 768px. Once it gets below 768px, each color must expand to the full-width of its container.
