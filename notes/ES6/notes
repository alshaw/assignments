😺 const and let:
-makes our code more readable
-will take the place of var

const:
-used for variables that cannot be reassigned a new value
-can add to arrays inside of const 
-can change the name of the property, just can't reasign the name

let:
-used for variables that might change
-block scoped as opposed to function scoped

var (only function scoped) will override everything unless it is in a function

Practice
change all the following vars to either const or let

const name = "Ben";  
let age = 24;  
const dateOfBirth = "feb";

const statuses = [  
  { code: 'OK', response: 'Request successful' },
  { code: 'FAILED', response: 'There was an error with your request' },
  { code: 'PENDING', response: 'Your reqeust is still pending' }
];
const message = '';  
const currentCode = 'OK';

for (let i = 0; i < statuses.length; i++) {  
  if (statuses[i].code === currentCode) {
    message = statuses[i].response;
  }
}

😺 Template literals:
- ben says they r vvv awesome
- designed for making strings easier to read and write

let name = "Allie";  
let age = 26;    
console.log("hello, my name is " + name + " and I am " + age + " years old.");  

is now this:

console.log(`hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`);  
- use backticks 



😺 Spread operators:
-cleaner way to concat()

const defaultColors = ['red', 'green'];  
const userFavoriteColors = ['orange', 'yellow'];
defaultColors.concat(userFavoriteColors);

is now this:

[ ...defaultColors, ...userFavoriteColors ];

const num1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const num2 = [6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
const num3 = num2.concat(num1);

😺 Desctructuring: 
-lets you extract data from an object

var expense = {  
  type: "Business",
  amount: "$45 USD"
};

var type = expense.type;  
var amount = expense.amount;

is now this:

const {type} = expense;
const {amount} = expense;

const petNames = ["Buzz", "Major", "Friskey", "Tiger", "Kona"]
let [buzz, , friskey, , kona]
