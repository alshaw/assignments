model - data
view - what the user sees
controller - 

1. uni-directional data flow (mono flow)
state -> view -> state

2. component based - breaks code into smaller, reusable pieces. makes debugging easier. 
a component is a function that generates an element

3. declarative - as apposed to implicit or imparative 
(instead of telling it how to do something, you're telling it what to do)

4. Uses the virtual DOM 
the v dom is a JS object that is assembled by react.
v dom is a copy of the original dom. v dom gets updated first and then updates the original dom.
